# Inventory-Management-System-with-files
A simple project in which I use file handling to manage the inventory.

Here, I have made a simple Python project which involves managing the inventory and recording the sales made by a shopkeeper.

Product details include:
1. Product ID
2. Product Name
3. Price
4. Quantity of a product in Inventory

I will be taking the input from the customer which will include his/her username, phone number, email ID and the quantity of the product he desires to purchase. I will then be printing the billing amount to be paid by the customer. If the quantity of the product that the customer desires is not available in the inventory, then I will print the quantity of the product available in the inventory and will confirm if he would like to purchase it.

The customer information taken earlier will then be saved in another file with the details of his purchase. This is for the shopkeeper to keep a record of all the purchases made in that period of time.

Any suggestions made will be taken positively.

Thankyou!
